Clarity: The graphic is in fact easy to read an has clarity in terms of the information it wants to present as well
of the axes it displays.
Esthetic: The difference in sizes of each observation in great to make a point about the value of it; the colors
selected are well balanced and are not distracting.
Honesty: The information is in no way deformed, and in my opinion is presented as needed; I would only 
modifi the range of the x and y axis (that start in a negative range) because none of the values presented 
are negative, making it unnecesary to start from that points; I would select 0,0 as the initial point for the
graphic.
