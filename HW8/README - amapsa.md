Clarity: I find the graphic innovative and visually atractive, but a little hard to read, because of the overlap
of the colors and lines, and the similarity of colors in some of the categories.
Esthetic: The visualization has a high impact and is visually atractive; however i find that i has two problems:
- Color in different cathegories are very similar and generate confusion
- The size of the graphic is too big and makes the user scroll up and down to check all of the information, which can be
a little bit confusing.
Honesty: I don't feel that the information is deformed in any way, but I find that the display type and size of the graphic
makes it somehow difficult to understand the information presented.
