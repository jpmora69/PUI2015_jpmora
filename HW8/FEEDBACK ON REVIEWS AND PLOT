associating rage to color is alwasys at risk of triggering preconceptions

labels too small

consider using amore compact notation for large numbers, for example plot income in units of $1,000  and say that in the label

size of poitns unexplained

the three default dots in the legend should be changed to 1 as they are redudnant

there is a lot of empty space in the plot. begin by removing empty space <0 on both axes, which is not meaningful anyways (no negative income)
