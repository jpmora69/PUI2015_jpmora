On the first notebook file (Homework week 3 - Distributions) I generated an sample example of 6 different 
distributions (Chi-squared - normal - binomial - poisson - expotential - logistic); after that I generated
100 random samples of different sizes for each distribution, and plotted the mean for each distributions
samples in a scatter plot.

Finally, I created a list to feed each of the means of each of the samples for each distribution, and 
transformed each of them into a Panda DataFrame, then joined all the dataframes to plot a joined histogram
of each distribution, as well a box-plot as an alternative visualization.
